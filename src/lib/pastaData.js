    "Spaghetti" : `Spaghetti is a type of pasta and, along with pizza, is a representative dish of Italian cuisine.

Originally, spaghetti refers to long pasta with a diameter of 1.8–2.0 mm, which is the most widely used type of pasta. The term "spaghetti" comes from the Italian word spaghetto, the diminutive form of spago, which means "string" or "thread." In many countries, most pasta dishes are based on spaghetti, leading to a tendency for the term "spaghetti" to be used as a synonym for pasta dishes in general. Conversely, the perception of pasta as a "noodle dish" is largely due to the overwhelming presence of long pasta, with spaghetti as its representative`,

    "Fettuccine": `A type of long, dried pasta made with eggs, shaped to be about 6 mm wide and 1 mm thick. Its name means "ribbon." Among flat noodles, it is relatively wide, making it firm and thick, so it tends to be cooked for a longer time. 

In cooking, it is primarily used in cream or cheese-based pasta dishes. A representative dish is Fettuccine Alfredo, which uses Alfredo sauce, a type of cream sauce, and is especially popular in the United States and other countries.`,

    "Penne": `A type of short pasta, the name penne comes from the Italian word penna (meaning "quill" or "pen"). Unlike macaroni, its ends are cut at a 30-degree angle, resembling a pen tip, and it is about 4–5 centimeters in length.

There are several varieties, including the commonly seen Penne Rigate (with ridges) and Penne Lisce (smooth), as well as larger-sized Pennoni, smaller Pennine, and shorter Mezze Penne. Penne pairs well with tomato sauce or ragù (meat sauce) and, when served cold, complements Oriental dressings. Among penne-based pasta dishes, the spicy tomato-sauce Penne all'Arrabbiata is particularly famous. Penne is also used in dishes like Timballo, a baked pasta casserole.

Due to its small surface area, penne tends to have one of the longest cooking times among pasta types. However, its large tubular structure allows sauces to cling well, making it ideal for those who enjoy pasta with abundant sauce. It works well with both hot and cold sauces, making it suitable for cold pasta salads.`,

    "Rigatoni": `A larger version of penne pasta, characterized by its tubular shape and varying lengths. It is a key ingredient in Timballo, a pasta dish traditionally enjoyed by the Pope, and is often used alongside penne.`,

    "Macaroni": `A type of short pasta, macaroni is tubular in shape, with some variations featuring smooth surfaces and a curved design. 

Unlike most pastas, which are commonly used as a main dish or entrée, macaroni is often utilized as a side dish or garnish. The macaroni and cheese is especially famous.`,

    "Linguine": `A flat pasta that resembles fettuccine in shape but is much thinner, as if spaghetti were flattened. The name comes from the Italian word meaning "little tongues." Its broad surface makes it a great match for oily pasta dishes or rich cream-based sauces. In Italy, it is commonly used in pasta dishes featuring seafood.`,

    "Farfalle": `
A short pasta shaped like a butterfly or ribbon. Its name comes from the Italian word farfalla, meaning "butterfly," with farfalle being the plural form.

Farfalle is commonly used in cold pasta salads, often alongside fusilli. Larger versions are called farfallone, while smaller ones are known as farfalline.`,

    "Tagliatelle": `It's a type of long pasta, about 6-8mm in width, long, thin, and flat. It's slightly wider and thinner than the similar fettuccine. It's commonly used in pasta dishes with rich sauces like ragù or cream sauce. The name comes from the Italian word "tagliare" which means "to cut".`,
    "Fusilli": `A type of short pasta, also known as fusilli or fusili. It looks like a spring or twisted shape, and is often used as a snack food. Although it's made from the same pasta dough as spaghetti, it has a slightly different cooking time. It takes about 12-14 minutes of boiling to reach the right consistency.

The name means "spindle" in Italian. As the name suggests, it looks like a spindle of thread. In northern and central Italy, the letter 's' between two vowels is pronounced as /z/, so it's also called "fusilli," while in southern Italian pronunciation it's "fusili." However, in English-speaking countries, it's commonly known as rotini.

This pasta has a pleasant chewy texture and pairs well with any sauce. Unlike long pasta that needs to be carefully twirled with a fork, fusilli can be easily eaten with a spoon or picked up with a fork while drinking or watching television, making it a popular choice for snacks along with penne and ravioli. As a short pasta with an attractive shape, it's also a common ingredient in pasta salads. Adding cheese makes it smoother and chewier in texture.`,
    "Orzo": `A type of pasta shaped like rice.
Even compared to other grain-shaped pasta like couscous or fregola, it looks remarkably similar to rice. In fact, it can be cooked almost the same way as rice! Because of this, it's sometimes used in Asian dishes in Italy. Looking at its shape, it looks just like slightly larger rice grains. However, it shouldn't be used in dishes that require long cooking times like risotto.`,
    "Conchiglie": `A short pasta shaped like shells. 
    With its concave shape that's perfect for holding sauce, it's more commonly used as stuffed finger food or in salads rather than in traditional pasta dishes`,
    "Bucatini": `As its name derives from "bucato" meaning "pierced," it's a pasta shaped like a tube with a hole in the middle. While it looks very thick from the outside, it cooks faster than expected thanks to the hole. Still, it takes relatively longer compared to other pasta types.
Because it's very thick, its texture can feel somewhat different from other pasta, so the key to cooking it is letting the sauce seep through the holes. It pairs particularly well with rich sauces.`,
    "Orecchiette": `As its name suggests "little ears," it's a pasta shaped like red blood cells and is made with durum wheat mixed with some barley flour instead of wheat flour`,
    "Ravioli": `A square or half-moon shaped Italian dumpling, a type of stuffed pasta. The filling typically includes meat and cheese, and other ingredients can be added according to preference.
It's also a very popular canned food alongside baked beans. In American college campuses during the 1980s, there were countless students who would stock up on boxes of canned ravioli when their parents sent them living expenses, surviving on it 365 days a year. It became a beloved food item because it was cheap and relatively tasty, allowing students to save on food expenses and spend the remaining money on other activities. This lifestyle pattern was so common that there's even a German drama titled "Ravioli." The final episode tells the story of four siblings who spend their parents' living allowance on their favorite canned ravioli while they're away, blow the remaining money, and end up getting so tired of ravioli that they throw a party and serve it to their guests. Apparently, many people developed a fascination with ravioli after watching this drama.`,
    "Tortellini": `An Italian-style dumpling, primarily filled with cheese, and sometimes with pork. If you eat it expecting the texture of a regular dumpling, you might be surprised by its unique texture. The larger version is called tortelloni`,
    "Fregola": `A rounded, grain-shaped pasta that's slightly larger than couscous. Like couscous and fregola, these small pasta types are typically used in soups and salads rather than eaten on their own.
It originated in Sardinia, Italy. As its name comes from "fregare" meaning "to rub," it's great for blending smoothly with sauces.`
