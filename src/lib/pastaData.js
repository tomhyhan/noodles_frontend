    "Spaghetti" : `Spaghetti is a type of pasta and, along with pizza, is a representative dish of Italian cuisine.

Originally, spaghetti refers to long pasta with a diameter of 1.8–2.0 mm, which is the most widely used type of pasta. The term "spaghetti" comes from the Italian word spaghetto, the diminutive form of spago, which means "string" or "thread." In many countries, most pasta dishes are based on spaghetti, leading to a tendency for the term "spaghetti" to be used as a synonym for pasta dishes in general. Conversely, the perception of pasta as a "noodle dish" is largely due to the overwhelming presence of long pasta, with spaghetti as its representative`,

    "Fettuccine": `A type of long, dried pasta made with eggs, shaped to be about 6 mm wide and 1 mm thick. Its name means "ribbon." Among flat noodles, it is relatively wide, making it firm and thick, so it tends to be cooked for a longer time. 

In cooking, it is primarily used in cream or cheese-based pasta dishes. A representative dish is Fettuccine Alfredo, which uses Alfredo sauce, a type of cream sauce, and is especially popular in the United States and other countries.`,

    "Penne": `A type of short pasta, the name penne comes from the Italian word penna (meaning "quill" or "pen"). Unlike macaroni, its ends are cut at a 30-degree angle, resembling a pen tip, and it is about 4–5 centimeters in length.

There are several varieties, including the commonly seen Penne Rigate (with ridges) and Penne Lisce (smooth), as well as larger-sized Pennoni, smaller Pennine, and shorter Mezze Penne. Penne pairs well with tomato sauce or ragù (meat sauce) and, when served cold, complements Oriental dressings. Among penne-based pasta dishes, the spicy tomato-sauce Penne all'Arrabbiata is particularly famous. Penne is also used in dishes like Timballo, a baked pasta casserole.

Due to its small surface area, penne tends to have one of the longest cooking times among pasta types. However, its large tubular structure allows sauces to cling well, making it ideal for those who enjoy pasta with abundant sauce. It works well with both hot and cold sauces, making it suitable for cold pasta salads.`,

    "Rigatoni": `A larger version of penne pasta, characterized by its tubular shape and varying lengths. It is a key ingredient in Timballo, a pasta dish traditionally enjoyed by the Pope, and is often used alongside penne.`,

    "Macaroni": `A type of short pasta, macaroni is tubular in shape, with some variations featuring smooth surfaces and a curved design. 

Unlike most pastas, which are commonly used as a main dish or entrée, macaroni is often utilized as a side dish or garnish. The macaroni and cheese is especially famous.`,

    "Linguine": `A flat pasta that resembles fettuccine in shape but is much thinner, as if spaghetti were flattened. The name comes from the Italian word meaning "little tongues." Its broad surface makes it a great match for oily pasta dishes or rich cream-based sauces. In Italy, it is commonly used in pasta dishes featuring seafood.`,

    "Farfalle": `
A short pasta shaped like a butterfly or ribbon. Its name comes from the Italian word farfalla, meaning "butterfly," with farfalle being the plural form.

Farfalle is commonly used in cold pasta salads, often alongside fusilli. Larger versions are called farfallone, while smaller ones are known as farfalline.`,
